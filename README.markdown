# Nostalgia 64

This is just some assembly code to draw on the Commodore 64. A friend came up with the idea to write some code again for the good old Commodore 64 and I couldn't resist trying it myself. After over 10 years I still can code on the 6502 processor. I hope I'll find more time to add additional drawing routines (like Bresenham's line drawing algorithm).

To create a binary from this source you'll need the [ACME Crossassembler for multiple environments](http://www.esw-heim.tu-clausthal.de/~marco/smorbrod/acme/). To run it you should either have a real Commodore 64 or an emulator like [VICE](http://www.viceteam.org/).

Have fun reliving those old times!
